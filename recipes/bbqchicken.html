    <h2>BBQ Chicken Recipe</h2>
    <p>The best BBQ chicken breast recipe doesn’t call for complicated marinades or rubs. It’s all about this easy on-the-grill or in-the-oven cooking method sweetened with BBQ sauce for moist and juicy barbecue chicken breasts every time.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 boneless skinless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>kosher salt , to taste</li>
        <li>freshly ground black pepper , to taste</li>
        <li>½ cup of your favorite BBQ sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the grill for direct cooking at high heat (450°F). Brush the cooking grates clean.</li>
            <li>Drizzle the chicken breasts with extra virgin olive oil and rub over the breasts. Season generously with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper.</li>
            <li>Place the chicken breasts on the hot grill. Cover and cook for 5-6 minutes or until they easily release from the grates. Flip the chicken and cook for 4-5 minutes longer. Baste the chicken breasts with BBQ sauce, flip and cook for 2 minutes on each side. Repeat on the other side. Cook until the breasts are firm to the touch and opaque all the way through, registering 160°F internal temp (the temp will rise to 165°F as the chicken rests).</li>
            <li>Transfer to a plate and cover with a piece of aluminum foil and let rest for 5 minutes. Serve with more BBQ sauce if desired.</li>
        </ol>
